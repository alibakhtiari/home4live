            question: "What's the difference between custom, semi-custom, and stock cabinetry?",
            answer: "Stock cabinetry comes in predetermined sizes, styles, and finishes, offering the most economical option but limited customization. Semi-custom cabinetry provides more flexibility with various size modifications and finish options while maintaining cost efficiency. Custom cabinetry is built specifically for your space with unlimited design possibilities, materials, and featuresâ€”offering the highest quality and perfect fit at a premium price. The right choice depends on your budget, timeline, and how precisely you want to optimize your space. During consultation, we can show examples of each and help determine which approach best serves your needs."
          },
          {
            question: "How long does custom cabinetry installation typically take?",
            answer: "For a standard kitchen with custom cabinetry, the entire process from initial design to completed installation typically takes 8-12 weeks. This timeline includes 2-3 weeks for design and planning, 4-6 weeks for cabinet fabrication, and 1-2 weeks for installation. Semi-custom cabinetry may reduce the timeline by 2-3 weeks, while stock cabinetry can further compress the schedule. Bathroom vanities and smaller projects generally require less time. These timelines can vary based on project complexity, material availability, and current demand. We'll provide a detailed schedule during your project planning phase."
          },
          {
            question: "What cabinet materials are most durable for kitchens?",
            answer: "For kitchen cabinet boxes, plywood offers superior durability compared to particleboard or MDF, particularly in moisture-prone areas. For cabinet doors, solid wood provides excellent longevity but may expand and contract with humidity changes. Thermofoil (vinyl-wrapped MDF) offers good moisture resistance at a lower price point. High-pressure laminate provides outstanding durability against scratches and impact. For luxury kitchens, we recommend premium hardwoods like maple or cherry for cabinet frames with solid wood or high-quality veneered doors. Your best choice depends on your budget, aesthetic preferences, and how heavily your kitchen is used."
          },
          {
            question: "Should bathroom fixtures match throughout the house?",
            answer: "While maintaining some consistency in bathroom fixtures throughout your home creates a cohesive feel, identical fixtures aren't necessary. A better approach is coordinating fixtures within each bathroom while ensuring all bathrooms share a compatible design language. For example, all fixtures might feature similar finishes (like brushed nickel or matte black) or share design elements (contemporary, traditional, etc.) while allowing variation in specific styles. Primary bathrooms can feature more luxurious fixtures, while guest bathrooms might have simpler designs. Our designers can help create a cohesive yet interesting fixture strategy across your home."
          },
          {
            question: "What are the most popular cabinet storage features?",
            answer: "Today's most popular cabinet storage features prioritize accessibility and organization. Pull-out trash and recycling bins eliminate freestanding containers. Deep drawer organizers with dividers properly store cookware and dinnerware. Pull-out spice racks and pantry shelves bring items at the back within easy reach. Vertical dividers organize baking sheets and cutting boards efficiently. Specialized drawers for knives protect blades and fingers. Corner cabinet solutions like lazy Susans or pull-out systems maximize traditionally awkward spaces. During design, we'll discuss your cooking habits and storage needs to recommend the most beneficial features for your lifestyle."
          },
          {
            question: "How do I choose the right countertop material?",
            answer: "Selecting the ideal countertop involves balancing aesthetics, durability, maintenance, and budget. Quartz offers exceptional durability and minimal maintenance with consistent patterning. Granite provides natural beauty and heat resistance but requires periodic sealing. Marble delivers unmatched elegance but is more susceptible to staining and etching. Solid surface (like Corian) allows seamless integration with sinks and backsplashes. Butcher block brings warmth but needs regular maintenance. Porcelain and sintered stone are newer options offering extreme durability and heat resistance. During consultation, we'll discuss how you use your space and help select materials that balance beauty with practical performance for your lifestyle."
