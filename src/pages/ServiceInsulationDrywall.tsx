            question: "What type of insulation is best for my home?",
            answer: "The best insulation type depends on several factors, including your climate, the area being insulated, your budget, and performance goals. For example, spray foam offers excellent air sealing and high R-value for areas like attics and rim joists, while fiberglass batts may be more cost-effective for standard wall cavities. During our assessment, we'll recommend the optimal insulation types for your specific needs."

          {
            question: "How much can I save on energy bills with proper insulation?",
            answer: "According to Energy Star, properly insulating your home can save approximately 15% to 30% on heating and cooling costs, depending on your existing insulation levels and climate. For the average Toronto home, this can translate to hundreds of dollars in annual savings. Beyond direct energy savings, proper insulation also reduces wear on HVAC systems, potentially extending their lifespan."
          },
          {
            question: "Is there special drywall for bathrooms and other moist areas?",
            answer: "Yes, moisture-resistant drywall (often called 'green board') is specifically designed for areas exposed to humidity but not direct water contact. For areas with direct water exposure, such as shower surrounds, we recommend cement board or other waterproof backer materials. We select the appropriate material for each area based on moisture exposure levels to prevent mold and structural issues."
          },
          {
            question: "How long does the drywall installation and finishing process take?",
            answer: "The timeline varies depending on the project size and complexity. For an average room, drywall installation typically takes 1-2 days, followed by 3-4 days for the finishing process (taping, mudding, and sanding), which requires multiple coats with drying time between each. We can provide a specific timeline during your consultation based on your project's scope."
          },
          {
            question: "Can you add insulation to my existing walls without removing the drywall?",
            answer: "Yes, we offer blown-in insulation services for existing walls, which requires only small access holes that are easily patched afterward. This method is ideal for adding insulation to finished walls without the disruption of complete drywall removal. We'll assess your walls to determine if this approach is suitable for your home."
